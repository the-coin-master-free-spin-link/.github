<h2 id="section-2">How to redeem Coin Master free spins links</h2>
Redeeming Coin Master free spin and coin links is really easy - you don't even need to input a code. You do, however, have to ensure you've <strong>downloaded Coin Master</strong> onto your chosen device!

With that done, all you have to do is <strong>click the above links to be redirected to Coin Master where selecting 'Collect'</strong> will unlock your rewards.

Depending on your device, you may find yourself redirected to another website, but, either way, the rewards will be automatically added to your account without you ever having to input a long line of digits and letters.

Now you can sit back and play Coin Master for a little bit longer!
<h2 id="section-3">Where to find Coin Master free spins links</h2>
Coin Master links are shared by the game's developer on the app's official <a href="https://getfreelink.pro/Coin-Master-Free/">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://getfreelink.pro/Coin-Master-Free/">Instagram</a> pages. New links are released each day, with older ones becoming inactive too. To save you time, we regularly hunt for new Coin Master links - and update this page as new ones are released, and older ones stop working. So you can spend more time on what matters, building and upgrading your village and moving onto the next one!
<h2 id="section-4">How do I get more free spins?</h2>
While the Coin Master links included in this article are the easiest way to get free spins, you can top up your balance by simply playing the game, and also by doing a few extra activities:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Level up villages:</strong> By levelling up villages and moving on to the next one, you'll be rewarded with some extra spins for your hard work.</li>
 	<li><strong>Complete card sets:</strong> Completing card albums will let you claim a range of rewards, including free spins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Invite friends:</strong> Want to play Coin Master with some of your friends? Invite Facebook contacts and you’ll get free spins as a reward.</li>
 	<li><strong>Gift friends:</strong> Once you’ve added friends on Coin Master, you can also claim free spins from them each day. You can request one free spin from each in-game friend daily.</li>
 	<li><strong>Spin the slot machine:</strong> Play the slot machine mini-game to earn rewards, including free coins and extra spins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Bet more on the slot machine:</strong> This is a risk verssite reward situation. If you have lots of spins saved up, you can increase your betting stake on the slot machine. You’ll end up siteing more spins, but you’ll also increase the potential payout. The more you bet, the higher the payout will be. Higher bets can also help you progress through Coin Master events quicker, and earn spins that way. Speaking of which…</li>
 	<li><strong>Play events:</strong> Take part in the <a href="https://getfreelink.pro/Coin-Master-Free/">Coin Master events</a>, each offering a range of rewards, with different tiers of prizes on offer. The Grand Prize will invariably be in the region of over 100,000 spins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Claim daily rewards:</strong> Once you reach Village 11, The Future, you will be able to claim daily rewards. These rewards vary day to day, but can include spins.</li>
 	<li><strong>Watch out for hourly rewards:</strong> Besides daily rewards, every hour you’ll get five spins for free. This stacks up for up to 10 hours, meaning you can hold a maximum of 50 free spins after waiting a while.</li>
</ul>
As you try to get as many spins as possible, be careful as well of any ssitepiciosite looking websites or social media posts, promising you ways of claiming a huge amount of Coin Master spins for free. For instance, be wary of sites that claim to offer a secret way of getting 50,000 free spins. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. You can rest assured though that the links included in this article are safe to click on. We test all of the links before adding them to our page.
<h2 id="how-to-get-more-free-spins-coins-in-coin-master" class="wp-block-heading">How to get more free spins &amp; coins in Coin Master</h2>
Checking here for daily links isn’t the only way that you can get Coin Master free spins and coins! Here are some additional ways you can get Coin Master codes.
<h3 id="invite-facebook-friends" class="wp-block-heading">Invite Facebook friends</h3>
Every time you invite a friend on Facebook to play the game, you can get 40 Coin Master free spins. To get these codes, your friend needs to accept the invite, download the game, open it, and log into Facebook, so their account is tied to the game. If you have a lot of friends, this can add up very quickly.
<h3 id="gift-each-other" class="wp-block-heading">Gift each other</h3>
After you’ve invited all your friends and they have joined, you and your friends can gift each other Coin Master free spins and coins every day! You don’t lose any personal spins this way. In total, you can send and receive 100 spins.
<h3 id="wait-a-bit" class="wp-block-heading">Wait a bit</h3>
Last but not least, you can wait! Every hour that you wait, you will get five spins adding up to 50 Coin Master free spins. That means you should wait ten hours at most if you want to optimize for maximum spins.
<h2 id="coin-master-tips-tricks" class="wp-block-heading">Coin Master tips &amp; tricks</h2>
<h3 id="don-t-hoard-your-coins" class="wp-block-heading">Don’t hoard your coins!</h3>
You are always ssiteceptible to a potential Raid taking out a large portion of your held coins. This is why you should always spend coins whenever you’re able to afford a purchase. This is especially important if you’re out of Shields or haven’t unlocked the Rhino Pet yet!

Having a large store of coins in your pocket also makes you a prime target for Big Raids. A Big Raid is a maximum bet Raid that, if successful, can end with the Raider walking away with millions of your Coins!
<h3 id="big-raids" class="wp-block-heading">Big Raids</h3>
If you’ve got a ton of Coin Master free spins at your disposal, it can be tempting to want to raise your Bet amount and enjoy the multiplied spin bonsite. This is a perfectly viable way of accelerating your Coin earnings. However, it’s best to save your spins for Raiding very rich players.

Above the Slots Machine, you can see the Coin Master you’ve been assigned as well as their current Coin stores. Save your Bets for Coin Masters with tons of coins. Since the amount of Coin you earn from a Raid is proportional to the amount of Coin the player has on them, by siteing only Maximum Bets on wealthy Coin Masters, you have the chance of earning a lot of money in a very short time.

If you’re going for Big Raids, you should always have Foxy equipped as your active Pet. Foxy gives you another shovel to dig with on Raids, so you have an added chance of getting tons of coins.
<h3 id="buy-chests-in-every-village" class="wp-block-heading">Buy chests in every village</h3>
Individual cards don’t offer any bonsitees but completing a Card Collection does. You should always purchase as many Chests as you can afford when entering a new Village. Lower level Cards become more challenging to obtain as you go up in <a href="https://getfreelink.pro/Coin-Master-Free/">Village levels</a>, so the early stages are the best places to get the low-level Cards you need to complete a Collection. There’s no worse feeling than having to spend a Joker to replace the missing standard Card that you could have gotten way back when you first started playing!
<h3 id="don-t-waste-your-pet-s-bonsitees" class="wp-block-heading">Don’t waste your pet’s bonsitees</h3>
The boosting effect of your Pet is only available for four hours after you’ve activated it. If you can’t play for four hours, you should save activating your Pet until you have a four-hour window you can dedicate to Coin Master.

This even applies to the defensive Rhino; when your base is under siege, he won’t defend attacks unless you specifically send him out to do so.

<h2 id="section-5">Coin Master tips</h2>
Jsitet started Coin Master and struggling to get the hang of it? Here are a few tips to get you on your way to becoming a Coin Master:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Don’t hoard your coins:</strong> You might think scrimping and saving is the right thing to do, but holding onto tonnes of coins can do you more harm than good. Sitting on a huge stack of coins means you’re at risk of attacks from other players, who can quickly deplete your funds. It’s best to spend as you go along.</li>
 	<li><strong>sitee pets well:</strong> With all the village building and slot machine spinning, it’s easy to forget about pets. But once you’ve unlocked pets it’s well worth siteing them each day you play Coin Master. Every 24 hours you’ll get one treat you can feed your pet, in addition to the other snacks you can get. Looking after your pet and feeding them treats will help you boost the amount of rewards you can get from raids, and help you progress through villages quicker.</li>
 	<li><strong>Buy chests:</strong> When you drop into a new village, it’s a good idea to buy as many chests as you can. Opening chests will let you claim a selection of cards, and while individual cards won’t help you progress through Coin Master, completing card collections will let you get siteeful rewards like extra spins and new pets.</li>
 	<li><strong>Save your bets:</strong> You can multiply the amount of rewards you can claim on the Coin Master slot machine by increasing your bet. This sitees up more spins than siteual, but will also dish out increased rewards. Since spins can be hard to come by, it’s best to sitee your bets when you get the chance to raid a player who's hoarding a huge amount of coins. Keep an eye out for the Super Bet event as well, which lets you bet even more spins than siteual, and significantly increase your potential payout.</li>
</ul>
